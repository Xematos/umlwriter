== Download

We distribute a http://www.php.net/phar[PHP Archive] (PHAR) that contains
all required dependencies of [label label-primary]#UmlWriter# bundled in a single file.

ifdef::basebackend-bootstrap[]
link:{pharstable}["Download the latest version",role="primary",icon="glyphicon-download-alt",options="block,white"]
endif::basebackend-bootstrap[]
ifndef::basebackend-bootstrap[]
link:{pharstable}[Download the latest version]
endif::basebackend-bootstrap[]

Make it executable, and put it into your `$PATH`.
[source,bash]
----
$ chmod +x umlwriter-1.0.0-RC2.phar
$ mv umlwriter-1.0.0-RC2.phar /usr/local/bin/umlwriter

$ umlwriter --version
----

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it.
[source,bash]
----
$ wget http://bartlett.laurent-laville.org/get/umlwriter-1.0.0-RC2.phar
$ php umlwriter-1.0.0-RC2.phar --version
----

With both methods then you have this output :

[role="output"]
====
----
umlWriter version 1.0.0-RC2
----
====

Alternatively, you can also use https://getcomposer.org/[Composer]
to create a new project from an existing [label label-primary]#UmlWriter# package.
This is the equivalent of doing a git clone checkout followed by a composer install of the vendors.

[source,bash]
----
$ php composer.phar create-project bartlett/umlwriter /path/to/install 1.0.0-RC2
----
Where +/path/to/install+ is your install directory.


== Generating a Diagram

UML diagrams produced, may be either :

* restricted to a simple class and its direct dependencies.
* restricted to a single namespace (with all its objects).
* non-restricted (all namespaces and their objects).

The following diagram processors (output formats) are available:

* Graphviz syntax with HTML-like labels
* PlantUML syntax with default fonts and colors

TIP: Detailed descriptions and examples of the diagramming languages are available on the
http://graphviz.org/[Graphviz] and http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/[PlantUML] websites.

The following reverse-engines are supported:

* {reflector-engine-1} (default in CLI mode)
* {reflector-engine-2}


== Generating a diagram statements from a Terminal

* In graphviz format with `bartlett/php-reflect` reverse-engine
+
[source,bash]
----
$ umlwriter diagram:render --reflector=reflect --processor=graphviz /path/to/data_source
----

* In graphviz format with `andrewsville/php-token-reflection` reverse-engine
+
[source,bash]
----
$ umlwriter diagram:render --reflector=tokenreflection --processor=graphviz /path/to/data_source
----

* In plantuml format with default reverse-engine (`bartlett/php-reflect`)
+
[source,bash]
----
$ umlwriter diagram:render --processor=plantuml /path/to/data_source
----


== Generating a diagram image

WARNING: You must have installed correctly graphviz or plantuml before to continue. 

* With Graphviz and `png` output format
+
[source,bash]
----
$ dot -Tpng -O /path/to/gv_file
----
+
Where +/path/to/gv_file+ is a file contening Graphviz syntax statements produced by
the [label label-primary]#umlwriter# command.

* With PlantUML and `png` output format
+
[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar plantuml.jar -Tpng /path/to/puml_file -o /path/to/ouput/dir
----
+
Where +/path/to/puml_file+ is a file contening PlantUML syntax statements produced by
the [label label-primary]#umlwriter# command.
+
And +/path/to/output/dir+ is the directory where the image will be generated.


== Summary

[role="lead"]
Let's review what we've done :

* downloaded the latest stable PHAR version.
* created project using Composer.
* built your first graphviz and plantuml UML diagram (and `png` image) from any data source.
